**Solution**:

Using Azure Table Storage (a NoSQL key-value store inside Azure Storage Accounts), that stores billing records less than 3 months.
And Azure blob storage that stores billing records older than 3 months. That gives us a more cost-effective and simpler route.

	- Azure Table Storage for storing new billing record (< 3 months) for fast read and write operations.
	- Azure Blob Storage for storing older billing records ( > 3 months) which are secure, read-only access to older records
	- Azure Functions (Node.js) to handle API requests and automate the archival process
	- Keeping it simple/understandable and cost-effective
